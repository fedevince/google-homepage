Summary of my  process:
- I created three containers for the headers, the main searchbox, and the footer
- the icons are imported from Google fonts api
- I tried to use flexbox for the general layout of the page and the container divs
- finally I did some CSS adjustments using the browser developement tools to compare it with the original
